# Oncrop

Oncrop is a web app that will crop a missing's friend face into the photo in real time. You place the photo by moving your phone around in the frame; the camera will track your phone using a provided ARUCO code. Don't worry, the web app is user friendly and will walk you through the steps.

## Installation
Oncrop requires several dependencies to run.

```sh
	$ python setup.py
```

## Use
```sh
	$ python app.py # cd into source/ directory first

```
Open the link that flask exports. It will be contained in a line that looks like this:
```sh
	$ * Running on http://127.0.0.1:8080/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```
The web app contains all of the instructions from there on out.
